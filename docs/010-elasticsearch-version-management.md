# Elasticsearch Version Management

This document provides guidance on managing Elasticsearch versions for the role to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features.

## Importance of Version Management

The Elasticsearch role uses a default version specified in `defaults/main.yml` (currently set to `8.12.2`). However, newer versions may include critical security patches, performance improvements, or new features. It's recommended to regularly check for updates and adjust the version used in your deployment as needed.

## How to Manage Elasticsearch Versions

### 1. Check for the Latest Version

Before deploying or updating your Elasticsearch cluster, visit the official Elasticsearch download page at [https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) to check for the latest available version. Using the latest stable version is advised for new deployments to benefit from recent improvements and fixes.

### 2. Override the Default Version

You can override the default Elasticsearch version by setting the `elastic_version` variable in `group_vars`, `host_vars`, or directly in your playbook. This allows you to specify a different version that suits your requirements.

Example in `group_vars/all.yml`:
```yaml
elastic_version: "8.15.0"  # Specify the desired Elasticsearch version
```

### 3. Testing Multiple Versions

If you need to test compatibility with multiple Elasticsearch versions, you can create separate inventory groups or environments with different `elastic_version` settings. This approach allows you to validate the role's behavior across versions without affecting your primary deployment.

Example in `group_vars/test_cluster.yml`:
```yaml
elastic_version: "7.17.9"  # Test with an older version
```

### 4. Version-Specific Configurations

Be aware that different Elasticsearch versions may require specific configurations or have breaking changes. Review the [Elasticsearch release notes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/release-notes.html) for each version to understand any changes that might affect your deployment. Adjust other variables in the role (e.g., JVM options, security settings) as necessary to match the version's requirements.

## Conclusion

Managing Elasticsearch versions effectively ensures that your deployment remains secure, performant, and compatible with your requirements. Regularly check for updates, override the default version as needed, and test across versions to maintain a robust Elasticsearch setup.
